This is a unified COVID-19 dataset to fulfill the following objectives:

- Mapping all geospatial units globally into a unique standardized ID.
- Standardizing administrative names and codes at all levels.
- Standardizing dates, data types, and formats.
- Unifying variable names, types, and categories.
- Merging data from all credible sources at all levels.
- Cleaning the data and fixing confusing entries.
- Integrating hydrometeorological variables at all levels.
- Integrating population-weighted hydrometeorological variables.
- Integrating air quality, comorbidities, WorldPop, and other static data.
- Integrating policy data from Oxford government response tracker.
- Integrating vaccination data from JHU Centers for Civic Impact.
- Integrating an augmented version from all sources (_future releases_).
- Optimizing the data for machine learning applications.

Note that COVID-19 data for some European countries from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) are reported in the global daily reports at province level, which will be replaced by higher-resolution data at NUTS 0-3 levels.

	abstract = {An impressive number of COVID-19 data catalogs exist. None, however, are optimized for data science applications, e.g., inconsistent naming and data conventions, uneven quality control, and lack of alignment between disease data and potential predictors pose barriers to robust modeling and analysis. To address this gap, we generated a unified dataset that integrates and implements quality checks of the data from numerous leading sources of COVID-19 epidemiological and environmental data. We use a globally consistent hierarchy of administrative units to facilitate analysis within and across countries. The dataset applies this unified hierarchy to align COVID-19 case data with a number of other data types relevant to understanding and predicting COVID-19 risk, including hydrometeorological data, air quality, information on COVID-19 control policies, and key demographic characteristics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by NASA Health \&amp; Air Quality project 80NSSC18K0327, under a COVID-19 supplement, National Institute of Health (NIH) project 3U19AI135995-03S1 ("Consortium for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB)"; Collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute and UCLA), and NASA grant 80NSSC20K1122.
